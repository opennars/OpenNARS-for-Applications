/////////////
//  Stamp  //
/////////////
//Keeps track of evidential bases
//This ensures that evidence is only counted once in the conclusions the system makes
//Design decisions:
//- Stamps are merged by zipping two existing stamps
//- Stamps have a max. capacity which controls how far the zipping goes
//- Since new inputs have a single stamp entry, new stamp entries will be in the beginning (1. or 2. element) of the stamp after revision

//References//
//----------//
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "Config.h"

//Data structure//
//--------------//
//Stamp as implemented by all NARS implementations
#define STAMP_FREE 0
typedef struct {
    //EvidentialBase of stamp
    long evidentialBase[STAMP_SIZE];
} Stamp;

//Methods//
//-------//
//zip stamp1 and stamp2 into a stamp
Stamp Stamp_make(Stamp *stamp1, Stamp *stamp2);
//true iff there is evidential base overlap between a and b
bool Stamp_checkOverlap(Stamp *a, Stamp *b);
//Whether two stamps are equal
bool Stamp_Equal(Stamp *a, Stamp *b);
//print stamp
void Stamp_print(Stamp *stamp);
