////////////////////////
// Variable utilities //
////////////////////////
//Support for NAL-6 variables
//This includes the ability to:
//- check for variables in terms
//- variable normalization
//- unification returning an unifier
//- substitution using an unifier
//- introduction of variables

//References//
//----------//
#include <stdint.h>
#include "Narsese.h"
#include "HashTable.h"

//Data structure//
//--------------//
//Substitution, mapping variable atoms to terms
typedef struct {
    Term map[27+1]; //there can only be 27 variables: $1 to $9 and #1 to #9 and ?1 to ?9, but it can't be 0
    bool success;
    Truth truth; //how well did it substitute?
} Substitution;
typedef Truth (*SimilarityQuery)(Truth, Term*, Term*); //to get access to memory querying for term substitutability
extern double Variable_similarity_distance;

//Methods//
//-------//
//Whether the atom is an independent variable, $i
bool Variable_isIndependentVariable(Atom atom);
//Whether the atom is a dependent variable, #1
bool Variable_isDependentVariable(Atom atom);
//Whether the atom is a query variable, ?1
bool Variable_isQueryVariable(Atom atom);
//Whether the atom is any variable
bool Variable_isVariable(Atom atom);
//Whether the term has variables of certain kind
bool Variable_hasVariable(Term *term, bool independent, bool dependent, bool query);
//Unify two terms, returning the substitution/unifier
Substitution Variable_Unify(Term *general, Term *specific);
Substitution Variable_UnifyWithAnalogy(Truth truth, Term *general, Term *specific);
Substitution Variable_Unify2(Truth truth, Term *general, Term *specific, bool unifyQueryVarOnly);
//Applying the substitution to a term, returning success
Term Variable_ApplySubstitute(Term term, Substitution substitution, bool *success);
//Introduce variables in an implication
Term Variable_IntroduceImplicationVariables(Term implication, bool *success, bool extensionally);
//Introduce var in conjunction
Term Variable_IntroduceConjunctionVariables(Term conjunction, bool *success, bool extensionally);
//Normalize variables, transforming ?what to ?1 for instance.
void Variable_Normalize(Term *term);
